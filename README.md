# Powershell Scripts

A collection of various powershell scripts I am using daily as a EUC Support Analyst. Most of them are related to SCCM / MEM & Application / Software Update deployments.

Small config file named _sccm-config.json_ contians common variables to be used within these scripts. E.g the SITE_SERVER_NAME & SITE_CODE. An example file is included.
